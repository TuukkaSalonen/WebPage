# Development
Run development react script with `npm start`

# Production
Run production react script with `npm build`

# Note
In my setup, the frontend is run within a Docker container and the source directories are copied and dependencies are installed inside Docker images. Also, environment variables such as the port, are passed for the image and the container.
