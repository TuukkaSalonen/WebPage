# Project details

## This is a repository for my personal website of tuukkasalonen.fi
It is only created for learning purposes to test full-stack web development techniques.

## Note
This site is not in active development but is used as a hobby.

## Running Docker compose
Run `docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yaml up` in the root directory.\
This runs the development version.
